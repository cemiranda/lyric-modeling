Lyric Topic Modeling Programs

Programs to get from Billboards top 100 songs, find their respected lyrics, and perform topic modeling on them.

LyricFinder.py:  takes a date and a rank 1-100 and attempts to get the respected song title and artist and then print out the lyrics. Year must be after 1952 because this is the farthest back Billboard has their list.
